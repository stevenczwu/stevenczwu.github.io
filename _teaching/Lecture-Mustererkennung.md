This [lecture](https://ies.iar.kit.edu/lehre_mustererkennung.php) provides a comprehensive overview of pattern recognition and classification. It begins with feature analysis, including types, transformations, selection, and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and ICA. It then covers classification theories, notably Bayesian decision theory and both parametric and non-parametric estimation methods. Various classifiers are introduced, such as SVMs, k-NN, decision trees, and perceptrons, along with special cases like sequence classification and rejection. Finally, it addresses practical issues like overfitting and introduces general learning principles and performance evaluation methods.
