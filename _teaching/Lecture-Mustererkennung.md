This [lecture](https://ies.iar.kit.edu/lehre_mustererkennung.php) covers key concepts in pattern recognition and classification, focusing on feature types, transformations, and dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA and ICA. It introduces Bayesian decision theory and methods for estimating class probabilities and parameters. Both parametric and non-parametric classification techniques are presented, including maximum likelihood, k-NN, and Parzen windows. A range of classifiers is discussed, such as SVMs, decision trees, perceptrons, and classifiers for sequences and nominal features. The lecture also addresses challenges like overfitting and explores learning principles, performance evaluation, and boosting.
