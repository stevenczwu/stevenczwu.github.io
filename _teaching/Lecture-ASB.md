This [lecture](https://ies.iar.kit.edu/lehre_asb.php) covers the acquisition, description, processing, and evaluation of image data for the purpose of automatic visual inspection. Various sensors and methods for capturing image-based data, as well as the relevant optical principles, are discussed. The mathematical description of image signals is examined in detail. The necessary system-theoretical methods and relationships are derived and discussed. The second half of the lecture focuses on the various sub-tasks and all major signal processing methods used in digital image processing and analysis.
