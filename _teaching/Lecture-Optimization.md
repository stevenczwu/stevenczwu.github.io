The term optimization refers to techniques for the identification of the best solution in a complex problem setting. Many applications from machine learning and engineering are based on solving an optimization problem. This [lecture](https://ies.iar.kit.edu/lehre_1487.php) introduces the major theoretical and algorithmic tools for solving of convex optimization problems. Practical problems for machine learning, engineering and further application domains are used as illustration. The students apply their knowledge to practical optimization problems in tutorial exercises.
