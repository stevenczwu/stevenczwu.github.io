Welcome! I received my master’s degree in Control Science and Engineering from Nanjing University in 2016 and my bachelor’s degree in Automation from Nanjing University in 2013. I worked in the Institute for Visualization and Data Analysis (IVD) at Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT) as a scientific staff member from April 2017 to March 2019. Since April 2019, I have joined Lehrstuhl für Interaktive Echtzeitsysteme (IES) at KIT and continued my work towards a PhD degree. My primary research focus is 3D computer vision, encompassing various areas. In applied research, he is deeply involved in the [AgiProbot project](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/wbkintern/Forschung/Projekte/AgiProbot/) (feel free to take the [virtual tour](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/wbkintern/Forschung/Projekte/AgiProbot/Tour/index.htm) !), where he handles tasks like point cloud segmentation, synthetic data generation, and sim2real transfer learning. In terms of theoretical research, he is engaged in developing new algorithms for self-supervised learning, 3D shape generation, and point cloud sampling (please check the [CVPR 2023 highlight paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14673) and recently accepted [CVPR 2025 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19581) ).

I am trying a new template, so this webpage is still under construction. Stay tuned! :)
