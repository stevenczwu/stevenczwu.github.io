Hi there! I am a Ph.D. at the Vision and Fusion Laboratory (IES) at Karlsruher Institut of Technologie (KIT), under the supervision of [Prof. JÃ¼rgen Beyerer](https://ies.iar.kit.edu/1473_1497.php). Before that, I was a research scientist at the Institute for Visualization and Data Analysis (IVD) at KIT. I received my masterâ€™s degree in Control Science and Engineering and my bachelorâ€™s degree in Automation from Nanjing University (NJU). 

My primary research focus is 3D computer vision, encompassing various areas. In applied research, I am deeply involved in the [AgiProbot project](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/wbkintern/Forschung/Projekte/AgiProbot/) (feel free to take the [virtual tour](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/wbkintern/Forschung/Projekte/AgiProbot/Tour/index.htm) !), where I handle tasks like point cloud segmentation, synthetic data generation, and sim2real transfer learning. In terms of theoretical research, I am engaged in developing new algorithms for self-supervised learning, 3D shape generation, and point cloud analysis (feel free to check my [CVPR 2023 highlight paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14673) and the recently accepted [CVPR 2025 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19581) ). I am also very interested in multi-modal learning, scene-level 2D image analysis (e.g. panoramic images), and vision-language models (e.g. video narration).

I am trying a new template, so this webpage is still under construction. Stay tuned! :)
