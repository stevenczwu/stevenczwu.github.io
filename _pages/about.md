Hi there! I am a Ph.D. at the Vision and Fusion Laboratory (IES) at Karlsruher Institut of Technologie (KIT), under the supervision of [Prof. Jürgen Beyerer](https://ies.iar.kit.edu/1473_1497.php). Before that, I was a research scientist at the Institute for Visualization and Data Analysis (IVD) at KIT. I received my master’s degree in Control Science and Engineering and my bachelor’s degree in Automation from Nanjing University (NJU). 

My primary research focus is 3D computer vision, encompassing various areas. In applied research, I am deeply involved in the [AgiProbot project](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/wbkintern/Forschung/Projekte/AgiProbot/) (feel free to take the [virtual tour](https://www.wbk.kit.edu/wbkintern/Forschung/Projekte/AgiProbot/Tour/index.htm) !), where I handle tasks like point cloud segmentation, synthetic data generation, and sim2real transfer learning. In terms of theoretical research, I am engaged in developing new algorithms for self-supervised learning, 3D shape generation, and point cloud analysis (feel free to check my [CVPR 2023 highlight paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14673) and the recently accepted [CVPR 2025 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19581) ). I am also very interested in multi-modal learning, scene-level 2D image analysis (e.g. panoramic images), and large language models (e.g. video narration).

I am trying a new template, so this webpage is still under construction. Stay tuned! :)
